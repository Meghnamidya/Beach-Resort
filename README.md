</ul>
<p align="justify">Different modules have been incorporated in this project to handle different parts and sectors of the resort management field, such as:</p>
<ul align="justify">
  <li>Index/Home Module</li>
  <li>About Us Module</li>
  <li>Rooms Module</li>
  <li>Activity Module</li>
  <li>Restaurant Module</li>
  <li>Contact Module</li>
</ul>
